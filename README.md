# R_analysis-Practice-Project
This is a project which shows the numbers of people with different education levels and also shows the state wise educated people with out jobs.

I have used dplyr,data.table,ggplot2,choroplethr packages in the R script

In case you face any problems in installing the any of the packages try to install directly from the CRAN site directly
Use the below command

install.packages("Package_Name", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com/", dependencies=TRUE)

There are two visualizations built in the Script

I have used ggplot2 to build a histogram

I have used choroplethr to build a map with show's intensity based on the concentration.

About the dataset --> i have found the data from one of the gov. site. I dint save the link..Sorry for that.

But i really dint use all of the data from it. i have cleansed the data and only taken few columns which are required.


Hope this helps you guys!!!!

Thanks
